# Sample Application

This is a simple text processing application that demonstrates basic file operations and data processing in Python.

## Features

- Command-line interface for processing text files
- Input validation to ensure proper data format
- Text statistics calculation (line count, word count, character count)
- Formatted output display

## Usage

```bash
python main.py <input_file>
```

Where `<input_file>` is the path to a text file you want to process.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `utils.py`: Utility functions for data validation and formatting

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external dependencies required

## Example

```bash
python main.py sample.txt
```

Output:
```
Processing Results:
====================
Line Count: 10
Word Count: 150
Char Count: 842
====================
